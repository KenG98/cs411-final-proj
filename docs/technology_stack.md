- `Pug`

## Frontend
- `Vue.js` 

## Database
- Either `mysql` or `mongodb`

## Explanation
When deciding our technology stack, we chose technologies based off of how well it fit our project and how much we wanted to learn that technology. For our backend server, we considered Flask because our team members had prior experience with it, but ultimately decided on Node.js with Express.js for routing and Pug for our view. This was because we wanted the convenience of using JavaScript for both our front and backend. And we also wanted to get more familiar with Node itself. 

For the frontend, we went considered not using a frontend framework but decided to use Vue.js because our team members have experience with it. 

For the database, we will either use MySql because we're learning that in cs460 Databases, or Mongo because we want to have a full stack JavaScript application.
