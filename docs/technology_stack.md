# Our Tech Stack and Explanation

## Backend
- `Node.js`
- `Express.js`

## Frontend
- `Vue.js` 
- `Pug`
- `Bootstrap`

## Database
- `MySQL` or `mongoDB`

## Explanation
When deciding our technology stack, we chose technologies based off of how well it fit our project and how much we wanted to learn that technology. For our backend server, we considered Flask because our team members had prior experience with it, but ultimately decided on Node.js with Express.js for routing and Pug for our view. This was because we wanted the convenience of using JavaScript for both our front and backend. And we also wanted to get more familiar with Node itself. 

For the frontend, we considered not using any frontend frameworks but decided to use Vue.js because our team members have experience with it. We're also using Pug to try it out, and we might add some elements from Boostrap later. We mainly wanted our frontend technologies to be simple to use.

For the database, we are considering both MySQL and mongoDB. The reasoning for MySQL is because we're using it in cs460 Databases, and we have the most experience with relational databases. 
The reasoning for mongo would be to learn how to use mongo, and also to have a full stack JavaScript application.
