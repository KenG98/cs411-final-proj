Give a Rating

As a user who has logged in (Story 2), I should be able to click on a link on my homepage (Story 3) and see my list of watched movies. I should be able to rate each watched movie out of 5 stars. Each movie should have a star rating field next to it. I should be able to click on the field to rate the movie, and reclick to remove the rating. I should be able to give half star ratings as well (eg. 3.5 stars). The lowest rating I will be able to give is 1 star, and the highest rating will be 5 stars.
