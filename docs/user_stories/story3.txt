Logged-in user Home Page

If a logged in user returns to the web app, or if a non-logged-in user logs in, they’ll be taken to the logged-in user home page. This page will have:

* The same movie search bar.
* A list of your liked movies, imported from Facebook.
* A list of watched movies and ratings you enter manually.
* A list of movies you’d like to see.
* A “get movie recommendation” button with an “advanced” button.

Entering text into the search bar pulls up results as before, except now there’s an “add to seem-list” or “add to watch-list”, and will prompt the user for a 1-5 star rating (Story 5) to see if they liked it or not.
