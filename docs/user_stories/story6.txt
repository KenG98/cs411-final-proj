Manage Your Watchlist

You may get multiple recommendations you want to watch. By adding a movie to your watchlist, you can keep track of what you’d like to see. From this list you can click that you’ve seen a movie (moving it to your seen-list, and giving it a rating) or you can remove it from your watchlist.
